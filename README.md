# Face Emotion Recognition

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of the DeepFace library for facial attribute analysis, including age, gender, race, and emotion detection from an input image. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook for easy execution on Google Colab.

## Description

The Face Emotion Recognition project utilizes DeepFace, a deep learning library for facial recognition and analysis. The key steps involve loading and displaying an image, analyzing the image to extract facial attributes, and displaying the results. This project serves as an example of how to leverage deep learning techniques for practical applications in facial analysis.

## Features

- **Facial Attribute Analysis**: Detects and displays age, gender, race, and emotion from an input image.
- **Visualization**: Loads and displays the input image using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
- **DeepFace Integration**: Utilizes the DeepFace library for deep learning-based facial analysis.
- **Result Extraction**: Processes and extracts detailed information from the analysis results.
